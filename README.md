# NPHA-NumberOfDoctorsVisitedPredictionAnalysis

In the file "NPHA_EDA_&_ModelComparison.ipynb":
Developed and evaluated various classification models on a healthcare dataset using Python, focusing on Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. Cleaned and preprocessed data, conducted performance analysis, and visualized model accuracy through bar plots and confusion matrices. 

In the file "NPHA_Hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb":
Data preparation, visualization using TSNE, and hyperparameter tuning for several classifiers such as SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting is done.

The results show that even after extensive tuning, the models struggle to achieve high accuracy, with the best performance around 55-56%. The project concludes with insights into the challenges faced and possible reasons for the limited model performance.
